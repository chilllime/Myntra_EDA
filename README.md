Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning projects. It helps in understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data. This project focuses on EDA for Myntra's dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance.

The EDA process involves the following steps:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

Data Visualization: 

Using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations for understanding distributions, correlations, and trends.

Feature Engineering:

Creating new features that might be useful for further analysis or modeling.

Statistical Analysis: 

Conducting statistical tests to understand the relationships and significance of different features.

Results and Insights:


The key findings from the EDA will be summarized in this section. Some possible insights might include:

Popular product categories and brands.

Expensive and cheapest product

Price distribution and discount patterns.

Sales trends over time.
